## 🔧 Technical Details

### **Audio Format**
- **Codec**: Opus (WebM container)
- **Sample Rate**: 44.1kHz
- **Quality**: High-quality voice recording
- **File Size**: ~50KB per 10 seconds

### **Browser APIs Used**
- **MediaRecorder**: For audio recording
- **getUserMedia**: For microphone access
- **Web Audio API**: For audio processing
- **FileReader**: For base64 conversion

### **Data Flow**
```
1. User clicks record → MediaRecorder starts
2. Audio data collected → Stored in chunks
3. Recording stops → Blob created
4. Blob converted to base64 → Sent via WebSocket
5. Server stores in Firestore → Acknowledges receipt
6. Other users receive → Audio reconstructed and played
```

## 🎯 Testing Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Basic Voice Message**
```
1. Record a simple "Hello, how are you?" message
2. Send and verify it appears correctly
3. Play back and confirm audio quality
4. Download and verify file integrity
```

### **Scenario 2: Long Voice Message**
```
1. Record a 30-60 second message
2. Test that recording stops at time limit
3. Verify larger file size handling
4. Test playback seeking functionality
```

### **Scenario 3: Multiple Voice Messages**
```
1. Send several voice messages in sequence
2. Verify all appear in correct order
3. Test playing multiple messages
4. Check that only one plays at a time
```

### **Scenario 4: Cross-Device Testing**
```
1. Send voice message from desktop
2. Open chat on mobile device
3. Verify voice message appears
4. Test playback on mobile
5. Try downloading on mobile
```

### **Scenario 5: Error Handling**
```
1. Try recording without microphone permission
2. Test with microphone disconnected
3. Try recording in unsupported browser
4. Test with poor network connection
```

- Users must explicitly grant permission
- Permission can be revoked at any time
- Clear indication when microphone is active

## 🚀 Performance Tips

### **Optimization**
- Voice messages are compressed using Opus codec
- Base64 encoding minimizes storage overhead
- Lazy loading for voice message history
- Efficient WebSocket transmission

### **Best Practices**
- Keep voice messages under 30 seconds for best UX
- Use good quality microphone for clear audio
- Record in quiet environment
- Test on target devices before deployment

## 📊 Analytics & Monitoring

### **Metrics to Track**
